<p onmouseover="makeBold(this)" onmouseout="makeNormal(this)"> Hello, My name is Michael Graver.  I am a student here at BYUI and I 
	am majoring in Computer Sceince.  It's a great major and I am glad I chose it. My favorite class
	so far is CS246-Software Design and Devlopment.  The reason I liked this class so much is because
	it allows students to take what they have learned from CS124 to CS235 and really see what they
	are capable of doing.  Plus being able to choose your own project, something I have to be a great learning tool
	in learning in this field.  A good chunck of what I know today has been from knowledge I earned
	while researching information to complete personal projects.  Web Engineering II though may become
	a great cometor because it is teaching really good skills to know but also because we have the chance
	to build our own project from scratch with everything we learn during the smester.

<p onmouseover="makeBold(this)" onmouseout="makeNormal(this)">
	My favorite hobby is playing video games.  It's something I have always enjoyed doing with my 
    free time to wind down after a long days work.  I play lot less now than when I was in high school
    that is probably for the best though because we all know that video games can very easily be a 
    distractor from more important things.  I currently have Playstation 4 and has been a great entertainment
    center for my home.  The next game I plan on getting is Monster Hunter World.  I have always heard 
    good things about the franchise but have never had the opportunity to play the games personally myself. After
    watching some gameplay and hearing that this is a great time for new comers to start playing I though 
    "This is the next game I am going to get."  If you want more information about the game you can find 
    its homepage <a href="http://www.monsterhunterworld.com/us/" onmouseover="makeBig(this)" onmouseout="makeSmall(this)">
    Here</a>.  Heres a screen shot of the upcoming game.

	One last thing I wanted to add was my favorite scripture below.  Its a saying that relates
	strongly to computer science becasue all computers are is a series of binary values that 
	allows us to conduct intense scientific caluclation or playing reltic video games.

<ins>The Book of Mormon</ins><br/>
<i>Alma 37:</i> <br/>
6: Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise. <br/>

 7: And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls. <br/> <br/>
